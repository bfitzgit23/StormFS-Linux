# Description: The K3b package contains a KF5-based graphical interface to the Cdrtools and dvd+rw-tools CD/DVD manipulation tools. It also combines the capabilities of many other multimedia packages into one central interface to provide a simple-to-operate application that can be used to handle many of your CD/DVD recording and formatting requirements. It is used for creating audio, data, video and mixed-mode CDs as well as copying, ripping and burning CDs and DVDs. Though k3b can be used to copy almost any DVD to similar medium, it does not provide a way to copy, or reproduce a double-layer DVD onto single-layer medium. Of course, there is not a program anywhere on any platform that can make an exact duplicate of a double-layer DVD onto a single-layer disk, there are programs on some platforms that can compress the data on a double-layer DVD to fit on a single-layer DVD producing a duplicate, but compressed, image. If you need to copy the contents of a double-layer DVD to single-layer medium, you may want to look at the RMLCopyDVD package.
